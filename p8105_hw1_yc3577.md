```

    ##  [1] "day"        "dewp"       "hour"       "humid"      "month"

``` r
# The variables are 'origin', 'year', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'temp', 'dewp', 'humid', 'wind_dir', 'wind_speed', 'wind_gust', 'precip', 'pressure', 'visib', and 'time_hour'.
#The explainations are below:
#Year is 2013 which means all data is happened in 2013 year. 
#Month is 1 which means all data is happened in Jan 2013.
#Day has a value from 1 to 15, which means all data happened within the 15 days.
#Hour has a value from 0 to 23, which means that all data happened within the 23 hours.
#Temperature has a value from 24.08 to 57.92, with a mean of 39.58.
#Dewp has a value from 8.96 to 53.06.
#Humid has a value from 32.86 to 100.
#Wind_direction has a value from 0 to 360, which means 360 degrees of directions of winds..
#Wind_speed has a value from 0 to 24.166.
#Wind_gust has a value from 16.11 to 31.07, and it has multiple null values.
#Precip has a value from 0 to 0.19, which means the precipitation amount.
#Pressure has a value from 1011 to 1034, and it also has multiple null values..
#Visible has a value from 0.12 to 10.
#Time_hour has a value from 2013-01-01 01:00:00.00 to 2013-01-15 23:00:00.00.

``` r

The pattern is fluctuating while it is a relatively positive association between temperature and time in these 15 days. The later the date, the higher the temperature is. The color of dot shows a humidity weather around 01-12 to 01-14, and other times are relatively dry.

#  From the as.numeric function, we can see that logical vector and factor vector can be transformed into numerical vectors, while the character vectors cannot. Since the logical vectors have only two values true and false and the R will assume true is 1 and false is 0. So it can convert the logical vectors to 1 or 0 numbers. The factor variables can be transformed into data based on the numbers of the levels of the factor. For instance, the first element is high in factor vectors, and it is assigned 1 as default, and the second element assigned 2 as default, and the repeated element same as the 1st one will be also assigned as 1. However, the character vectors does not have similarities or orders, so the R cannot assign a number to quantify it. That is why character vector does not have the mean, as it cannot be transformed into numerical vectors.
